# Equity-Portfolio-Management
This is a project done in R programming language for stock market analysis of 10 big companies for the year 2018


I have uploaded a project task file which is .ipynb format, you can find it by the name "Project Tasks.ipynb"

I have also uploaded the .csv files used as data frames in the project, so you just have to make some changes in your program which are as follows:

  Once you have the csv files in your local machine, just copy the path of your csv files and paste it in the first cell itself which says "a <- read.csv("D:/NJIT/Sem 3/Data     Analytics/Midterm Project/IBM.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)".
  So instead of using the path which I have defined for my local machine, use the path of your machine where the csv file resides.
  For example: my path is "a <- read.csv("D:/NJIT/Sem 3/Data Analytics/Midterm Project/IBM.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)"
              if you download the csv files in a folder called "D:/Github_project",
              what you can do here is, a <- read.csv("D:/Github_project/IBM.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
  You have to do that for all the other 9 data frames (csv files) and you are good to go for running the project.
